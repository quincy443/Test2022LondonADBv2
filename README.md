# output files

Two files are created when the reocord button is invoked :

1. .wav audio file

   |aud| 211130_081256|d|0106|f|f00402500|g|3|.wav |
   |---|--------------|-|----|-|---------|-|-|---- |
   |   | 2021 Nov 30 8:12:56|distance|1-6m|frequency|40 - 2580Hz|amplitude gain|x3| |

2. .csv file  
   The csv file contains distance data from live feed via distance sensor
   file naming convention
